# chuni-hands-evolved
Another mysterious tool that detects things. Inspired by [chuni-hands](https://github.com/logchan/chuni-hands)
- Can output both keybinds or use Brokenithm-Evolved's chuniio

# Usage Notes
In most cases you will not need to turn on keybinds output option (unless you are doing something custom)

If you are using this with UMIGURI and are using [brokenithm-evolved-ios-umi](https://git.moekyun.me/pinapelz/brokenithm-evolved-ios-umi), keybinds option is not needed.

The UI will lag when the update rate is set to low, its recommended that you first configure using a high update rate, then set it as low as possible for use to ensure minimal latency.

*It takes some time to start up, so please be patient*.
